# Sunrise and sunset calculation in C#

Heavily cleaned up and simplified C# library to calculate the sunrise and sunset for a location on earth on any given date. Compiled for .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.5.2, .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Core 2.0.

## Usage

```C#
// Date for which to calculate the sunrise and sunset
var date = DateTime.Today;

// Latitude for which to calculate the sunrise/sunset
var latitude = 52.3702157;

// Longitude for which to calculate the sunrise/sunset
var longitude = 4.8951679;
            
// Hours from UTC which this location is in
var utcOffset = TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now).Hours;

// Write the output to the screen
Console.WriteLine("Date: " + date.ToLongDateString());
Console.WriteLine("UTC Offset: " + utcOffset);
Console.WriteLine("Coordinates: LONG " + longitude + " LAT " + latitude);
Console.WriteLine("Sunrise: " + SunSetRiseLib.SunriseAt(latitude, longitude, date, utcOffset));
Console.WriteLine("SunSet: " + SunSetRiseLib.SunsetAt(latitude, longitude, date, utcOffset));
```
